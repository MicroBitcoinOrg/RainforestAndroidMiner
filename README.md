# Rainforest Miner for Android

This is an Android miner with some minial changes to the UI that is built from BitZeny Miner for Android based on [cpuminer](https://github.com/bitzeny/cpuminer). Cpuminer is modifed to work as a library through JNI.

Miner contain of the Rainforst v2 crypto currency algorithm. It is designed to rebalance the mining power towards the users and not the big corporations anymore. It achieves this by being extremely fast on modern 64-bit CPUs including low-power ones such as A53, still efficient though not as fast on GPUs, and not affordable to implement at all on FPGAs or ASICs. It makes intensive use of pseudo-random in-cache memory accesses and advanced instructions found in modern CPUs like AES, CRC, 64-bit divide, making
set-top-boxes and smartphones as fast as high-end PCs and as fast as mid-end GPUs.
